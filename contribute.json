  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Is Arctyll open-source?",
      "answer": "Only partially. Some tools are public on GitHub, but others remain private due to security and stability concerns."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need to know Minecraft modding?",
      "answer": "Not at all. While some projects involve Forge, most of Arctyll’s ecosystem revolves around software tools, web tech, and utilities."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I help without coding?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. Testing, design feedback, writing, translation — all of that is super helpful."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I officially join the team?",
      "answer": "Start by contributing through the public projects or reaching out via the contact page. We notice consistent, thoughtful contributions."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I report a bug or issue?",
      "answer": "Use the contact page or open an issue on GitHub if the project is public. Be clear and detailed — it helps us fix things faster."
    },
    {
      "question": "What skills are most helpful?",
      "answer": "Programming (Java, JS/TS), UI/UX design, localization, and testing are the top areas — but passion and creativity matter most."
    },
    {
      "question": "What tools do you use internally?",
      "answer": "VS Code, IntelliJ, Vite, React, Forge (1.8.9), GitHub, and Figma — we’re open to new workflows if they improve collaboration."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I contribute anonymously?",
      "answer": "Yes, though we encourage consistent identities for proper recognition. Anon feedback and bug reports are always welcome."
